## To-Do

* Create a setup command that takes a certain number of channels to monitor rather than taking every channel for every server
* This number can be increased with premium 
* Choose length of time to set app to consider inactive. 30 days is the default
* Make database for guilds
    - Columns = Guild ID (string), Server Owner ID (string), isPremium (bool), ChannelIDs (comma separated list of strings)
